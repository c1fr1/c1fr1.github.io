					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSo apparently fatigue is a thing! The only thing I did well during this ludum dare was the polish. I had just finished a 2 week programming workshop where I worked in a group to make a different game. The ludum dare started while I was still presenting my game from that workshop. I had been working hard on that game, so I didn't have very much energy left for ludum dare. I didn't even have enough energy to get the game 20 ratings for the first time. I did get audio in for the first time though, even though it is bad audio. Better than none I guess.

					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe last wall chases your carrocter across a bright world while evil carrots try and knock you in. You can blast them around so that they don't hit you, but if you just dodge them, it will only bring the wall closer!
