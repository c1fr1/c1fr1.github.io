					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGiven a relative rotation camera, you can experience full 3D combat, just with mindless targets. You have a number of abilities that can help with your journey. The first is matching velocities with a target object. Doing this costs a little bit more than it would be to do so manually, but it is very precise. You can match velocity with an object by targeting it, then pressing Q. The other ability is highlighting all of the asteroids. When this is active, you can even see asteroids behind the transport ship. highlight asteroids by pressing E.
