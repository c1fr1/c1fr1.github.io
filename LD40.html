					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis was the first ludum dare I contributed to, I had very little knowlege of LWJGL, the library I was using for the graphics. Looking back on it now all I can do is cringe, but I still think I learned a lot while making it, so I am glad I did.

					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe objective of the game is to buy as many upgrades as possible. Upgrades cost gold, and can only bought once you have beaten the second level, after which you will restart with whatever gold you have left and any upgrades you bought.

					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe big gimmick is that coins will slow you down, so you want to manage how many coins you collect. On the first level, there are only coins. On the second level, there is lava that can kill you, and a dark wall that will slowly drain you gold, then your life.
