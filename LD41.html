					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAhh, the first ludum dare where I knew what I was doing, or so I thought. The theme was combine two incompatible genres, which was a pretty bad theme in my opinion. I decided to combine a match-3 with a platforming game. While I understand what is going on, the rules are too hard to understand for most people playing the game. This time I knew how to use LWJGL, but I still have much to learn when it comes to game design.

				<p class="body">
					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe idea is that you jump from pillar to pillar, matching different cubes as you go. You always have a color, your color determines which color of blocks you can pass through, while all of the other ones are solid. When you match 3 colors, they become the color that you are. Your score increases with each match, and increases more the further to the right you are.

					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere will always be a black wall in front of you. You push it forward by making reaching a higher score.
				</p>
				<p class="body">
					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs your score increases, lasers start firing at you. Each laser has a color, and will change the color of each block they pass through on the tower that you are on. If a laser hits you, it changes your color and the 9 blocks around you, causing you to fall a block.

					&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSo far this is the only ludum dare where I actually made a post mortem. It adds a new mode that has a second wall that chases you. If the second wall catches up with you, then you fall, because you are all the colors.
